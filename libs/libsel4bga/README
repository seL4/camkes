Overview
~~~~~~~~
What you are looking at is a very basic driver for the Bochs Graphics Adaptor,
hereafter referred to as BGA. This device is available under QEMU when you pass
the command line option "-vga std". The driver has some limitations, such as no
support for banked mode which would increase performance.

There's currently only support for IA32 (is the BGA even available as a device
under ARM?).

TODO
~~~~
 - Some example code of how to use this driver.
