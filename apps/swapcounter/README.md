# Swap Counter Example

This directory contains a simple CAmkES example the was used for demonstration
purposes in a submission to [Formal Methods 2015](http://fm2015.ifi.uio.no/).
The app has since been modified from the version what was used in the paper submission as
the tooling for automated verification of RPC stub code isn't actively maintained,
but the old version can be obtained from https://github.com/seL4/camkes-manifest/tree/FM2015.
